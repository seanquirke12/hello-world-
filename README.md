# hello-world-
Hi all! 

The reason for this change is to get a little practice in using Github (following the initial starter guide) and to offer a little introduction to who I am

My name is Sean and i'm an Associate Recruiter with a GLobal Organizational Consulting Firm called Korn Ferry. I am on rotation with their RPO (Recruitment Process Outsourcing) practice based in the UK with Hewlett Packard Enterprise. I maintain a passion for people and their ability to make tangible change in the world, and for promoting easy and open access to information that can help make all our lives that little bit easier!
